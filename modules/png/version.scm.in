;;; Commentary:

;; This module contains procedures that allow to acquire information about the
;; Guile-ICS version in the Semantic Versioning format. [1]
;;
;; Guile-ICS version consists of three parts:
;;   MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
;;
;; The procedures below allow to get any of the version part or the version as
;; a whole.
